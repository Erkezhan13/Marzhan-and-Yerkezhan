# Contributing
If someone wants to make their own calad, they can add something, but they should not destroy the rhythm because the code will not work out so I recommend understanding the code first.
# License
We have a tool to understand the interface of our code to distribute it.
# Credits
When we were working on this project, we watched videos on YouTube and relied on chatjpt information, and as a result, we looked at all the information from the python book and understood the context, it helped us a lot and website practicum.yandex.kz
